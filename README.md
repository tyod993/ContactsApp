# ContactsApp
Simple contacts app using jetpack compose
This is a very simple contacts application created for an interview with Visa. The main functionality of the application has been implemented. 

##TODO
There are still many things left to implement to make this a complete application. The UI could use some polishing as itâ€™s a bit crude. On the back-end there are some architectural changes that could be implemented that would make the application more scalable and clean and decoupled.
